## Description

Our platform provides a smooth environment for online education . Some students face issues in some subjects and in this every day hustle of college and studies there is no time to go to classes . Using our platform students can learn from remote tutors from the ease of their houses. Along with this for teachers , we have many features lined up so that they can teach students efficiently without any issues and keep track their performances efficiently
